In this section of the repository, you will have the codes to make the connection via Bluetooth. On the one hand, we have the codes named hc-05, which will basically be used to check that the Bluetooth module installed in the Arduino works perfectly once it has been configured.

Subsequently, once the communication works, the other pair of codes will be executed to carry out the communication in order to transmit the data.
