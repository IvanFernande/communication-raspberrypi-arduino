# I2C communication for a Raspberry Pi

## Introduction
This repository aims to collect different methods for communication between an Arduino MKR WAN 1310 and a Rapberrry Pi 3 model B+. The communication between these different devices is a key point in the IoT world as it allows devices at the edge to have a higher computational capacity without the need of an online server. 

During the development of these files, work was being done with a focus on agriculture, an area where the internet of things is crucial for monitoring soil moisture and irrigation data, as well as other necessary actions. 

In addition, by giving the spotlight to boards like the Rapberry Pi, the integration of AI into the internet of things, with applications such as complex data analysis, behavioural predictions and many more, is being driven!

Therefore, here are some example codes for use, to guide other users who are looking for such implementations.
