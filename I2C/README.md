In this section, there are 4 files, grouped 2 by 2, being the i2c.py and i2c.ino files, communication files between the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi with a very poor data verification, leaving the code open to the use of a method selected by the user.

On the other hand, the i2c_crc32.py and i2c_crc32.ino files are files that allow communication between the two devices with the CRC32 method to verify correct communication.
